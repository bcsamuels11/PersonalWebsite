        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          A significant part of my experience in software engineering has come
          from industy experience in the form of internships. I did my first
          internship in my senior year of high school as a part of a senior
          project. Since then I've done longer internships over each summer and
          I've done shorter internships over MIT's extended winter break, known
          as the Independent Activities Period (IAP).
